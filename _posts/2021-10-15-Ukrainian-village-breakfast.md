Olia Hercules’ traditional Ukrainian breakfast eggs recipe – made with chicken, kale and shallots – is a hearty treat that will set you up for the day.

Olia says: “Ukrainians don’t do breakfast by halves. Anything you fancy or that’s in season can go with these eggs, but the ingredient that makes this dish quintessentially Ukrainian is good quality lardo (pork fat). I know a lot of people are into clean eating these days, but we Ukrainians love our lardo. It envelops everything with the most wonderful porky flavour – a flavour we can’t live without”

Ingredients
-------------------
* 50g lardo, chopped (see know-how)
* 1 shallot, thinly sliced
* 1 free-range chicken breast, thinly sliced lengthways (optional)
* 100g kale
* 4 medium free-range eggs

Instructions
-------------------
1. Cook the lardo in a large frying pan over a medium heat for about 5 minutes until most of the fat has been rendered (melted). Add the shallot and cook until it starts to turn golden (about 4 minutes).
2. Add the chicken (if using) and cook for 2 minutes, then add the kale and cook for another 5 minutes.
3. Finally, crack in the eggs, season and cook. You can leave them whole and cook until the whites have set and the yolks are still runny, or mix them in to scramble them – it will taste great either way.
